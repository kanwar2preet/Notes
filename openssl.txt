openssl is bacically a toolkit which consists of number of utilities.

If we build openssl package, private/ and certs/ directory will be empty.By default open ssl doesnot contain any root certificates.


Key and Certifiacte Management: 

3 steps: 

1) Generate a strong private key.
2) Create a Certificate signing request and send it to CA(certificat Authority).
3) Install the CA provided certificate.

Considerations for keys:

Openssl supports RSA,DSA and ECDSA keys. Atleast try to use 2048.

##use below command to generate keys:
openssl genrsa -aes128 -out fd.key2048
