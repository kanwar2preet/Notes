help(re)

dir(re) gives u methods etc available

\n - new line character
\t - Tab character
\U - stands for Unicode



raw string: 

Helps to deal with path etc as we need to interpret them properly

rawstring = r"C:\Users\tasks"

compile method in regurar expression.

match 4 digits in a row

s = r"\d{4}"

when you want to search for the same pattern over and over again perhaps in different target strings --->

use re.compile to create regex object which then can be used with find all method to look for occurrences of the same pattern inside various 
target strings



So in conclusion you can use the compile method when you are searching for the same pattern over and over again and in multiple 
target strings. On the other hand you can use all the other methods  without worrying about compiling the regular expression first 
whenever you are searching for various patterns inside the same target string says the compiling is done automatically with each method.

Search method() only returns the first occurance of the pattern in the string
