Two types of users we can create,

normal user which is used to access the cluster externally, using the API. 

For instance, through "kubeclt", this user is not managed using objects. 

second type: a service user, which is managed by an object in Kubernetes.

User is used to authenticate within the cluster. For instance inside a pod or from.
